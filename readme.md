This branch holds the project part that was created to deploy the chatbot solution into GCP<br>

I simply followed the tutorial of [thaddavis](https://github.com/thaddavis) on [how to deploy a dockerized fastapi to google cloud run](https://github.com/thaddavis/how-to-deploy-a-dockerized-fastapi-to-google-cloud-run)

**WARNING:** This part of the project is under work and it still does not work.<br>
